## Labels
Please try and rank the severity and add relevant labels of the issue as best you can.

### Severities
trivial - Doesn't make almost any difference to gameplay at all such as a missing block animation on an NPC in combat.

major - Serious and large piece of content missing or vital mechanic to the game not functioning properly.

critical - Could destroy the game if left unchecked such as a dupe, crash, unbalanced resource or money source, etc.

blocker - This should only be used by developers as it is for describing a system or feature that needs to be implemented into the engine before continuing with another feature.

### Types
missing-content - This is if something is missing that should be there such as an NPC spawn, shop, drop, or dialogue.

bug - Use when there is a problem with existing content that is not working as intended.
